# Titanic-ML-Analysis

This project focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using Python and the scikit-learn package. The objective was to explore a variety of binary classification methods to determine the most effective model for predicting survival. Additionally, clustering techniques were applied to identify similarities among passenger groups and features.

A notable discovery from this experiment was the variability in model performance across different classification methods. Despite the popularity of Neural Networks, it was found that their performance did not consistently outshine other models for this specific task. Instead, the Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, delivering superior results compared to all other models tested.

Feel free to suggest other models or any change in paramters!

To set up the environment, install these libraries using pip:
```python
pip install pandas scikit-learn
