Titanic Survival Prediction using Python + Sk-Learn package. The objective of the project is to use a comprenhensive set of binary classification methods to find the better results for the survival of the passengers of the Titanic. Clustering methods were also used to find similarity amongst certain groups and features. 
The most interesting find in this experiment was that Neural Networks, despite their fame, are not always the best option in classification tasks. It is different from problem to problem, there is no better model in general; but today, the winner was the Random Forest Model, as it gave us the better results over all the other tested models.
Feel free to suggest other models or any change in paramters!
